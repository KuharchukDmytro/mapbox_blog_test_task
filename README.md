# Project README

This repository contains the code for a blog application with different sections, each focusing on a specific task.

## Sections

### Section 1: Database Design and Querying

#### Database Schema

The "back" folder contains the backend code (Express) for managing the PostgreSQL database schema. The schema includes tables for posts and comments with proper relationships.

#### Querying

A query has been implemented to count the number of comments for each post and display the post title alongside the comment count.

#### Error Handling

Error handling middleware is set up in the backend to catch and log errors with appropriate status codes.

### Section 2: Next.js

The "front" folder contains the frontend code (Next.js) related to the backend in Section 1.

#### State Management

A Next.js component has been developed for displaying a list of blog posts/comments. State management is implemented to dynamically update the UI when new posts/comments are added/deleted.

#### Form Handling

A React form is created for adding comments to a post, ensuring proper handling of form submission and updating the UI accordingly.

### Section 4: Mapbox GL JS

The "mapbox" folder contains code related to Mapbox GL JS. It focuses on creating a map and loading point, line, and polygon GeoJSON data with proper styling.

### Section 5: Problem-Solving Skills

#### Scenario-based Problem

In the event of database performance issues, follow these steps to identify and resolve the problem:

1. **Performance Monitoring:** Utilize monitoring tools to identify any spikes or unusual patterns in database activity.
2. **Query Optimization:** Analyze and optimize database queries for efficiency, ensuring indexes are appropriately set.
3. **Database Indexing:** Implement necessary indexes on columns frequently used in queries.
4. **Scaling Options:** Consider scaling options, such as vertical scaling (upgrading hardware) or horizontal scaling (adding more servers).
5. **Caching Strategies:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database for frequently accessed data.
6. **Database Sharding:** If applicable, explore sharding the database to distribute the load across multiple servers.
7. **Query Profiling:** Use query profiling tools to identify slow queries and optimize them.
8. **Database Schema Review:** Review the database schema for any potential improvements or normalization.

Feel free to explore each section for detailed code implementations and instructions on running the application. Happy coding!
